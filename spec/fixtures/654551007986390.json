  "description": "+++ THEME OF THE MONTH: HOMOSEX 101: INTRODUCTION TO FAGGOTRY +++\n\nWelcome back homos!  You all did such a great job last month proving that gay men can actually get along and ENJOY being around each other, no matter age, build, race, fem, masc.  It was a badass night full of the most diverse group of men who love men I've seen in a long time.  So why not do it again?  This month we're taking things \"back to school\" because we like to be current and timely and all that jazz, so the theme is a dirty gay Sex Ed class, a collegiate romp full of all the grit and naughty energy you know and love from our humble venue.  And expect a couple weird surprises as well, because we like to be a little WTF? in case you hadn't noticed.\n\nDRESS CODE: Slutty Schoolboy or Pervert Professor.  Bust out your shirt and tie, your school colors, your old letterman jacket.  Come show us how much school spirit you have in those khaki pants of yours.\n\n++++++ AREA 2181 ++++++\n\nEvery third Saturday Lavender Underground presents AREA 2181, a cutting-edge dance party created for gay guys from ALL walks of life. We’re breaking down the barriers that divide the gay nightlife scene and bringing boys and men together in one big celebration, where we can rediscover our similarities instead of emphasizing our differences. We want to show guys looking to experience gay nightlife that they have other options besides getting gawked at by bachelorette parties, playing around with their iPhones, or feeling judged and insecure. And this ain't just a party where you get into your skivvies and call it a day. The theme will change every month, giving you a brand new experience each time – new attractions, new costumes, new shot specials every month. So come get faggoty, ‘cause this is YOUR party.\n\n+++ RESIDENT DJ PAVONE +++\n\nDEREK PAVONE has been making asses shake up and down the West Coast for nearly a decade. While he has been known primarily as a disco DJ, AREA 2181 will see him stepping away from his classic sound and into the darker corners of house, acid and techno.",
